# Phase 2 Blog - The Repo

## The Feynman Technique & Web Scraping 

  In this repository, you will find a notebook that I have adapted from a Flatiron School lecture notebook on Web Scraping. I was not certain that I fully grasped the topic in Phase 1 due to the pace of the program and the volume of information learned. Being that I want to be the best Data Scientist I can, I am circling back on the topics I feel weak in, starting with this one!
  
  I have recreated the notebook and used the original lecture notebook as a guide with the sole intention of solidifying my understanding of the topic by using the Feynman Technique and "explaining" it to you in my Phase 2 blog post. I used snips from my modified notebook for demonstration purposes only in the blog post, and have cited the original both here and in the blog as well. Code and websites have been borrowed from the original lecture notebook, while markdown cells are my own.
